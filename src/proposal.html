		<h1>WDD 330 Final Project Proposal</h1>
		<section>
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt>Overview</dt>
				<dd>This website will be a quick and easy tool to look through upcoming anime titles, sorting by various parameters including show information and the presence or absence of user tags (probably a "star", "watching", and "dislike").</dd>
				<dt>Target Audience</dt>
				<dd>The target audience is regular anime watchers who are not "hardcore" enough to be easily on top of what's coming up and just want to keep up with what's available.</dd>
				<dt>Major Functions</dt>
				<dd>Major functions include listing anime titles by season, listing anime titles by ranking, sorting listed titles, marking titles with tags, and displaying additional details about the selected title.</dd>
				<dt>External Data</dt>
				<dd>I am using the myanimelist "Get seasonal anime" and "Get anime ranking" api endpoints.</dd>
				<dt>Module List</dt>
				<dd>
					<ul>
						<li>AnimeList: Fetches and contains a list of anime titles.</li>
						<li>Filter: Stores and manages filter settings.</li>
						<li>AnimeDetails: Stores and displays the details of an anime in a modal.</li>
					</ul>

				<dt>Challenges</dt>
				<dd>Honestly, the biggest challenge was always going to deciding what to make, I'm not very good at that. I am quite good at code though and my knowledge extends well beyond the scope of this course, and the vast majority of the theory and patterns mentioned in this course I was already using in my websites, including using external APIs. In the end, I could only manage to come up with a design for something simple so I don't expect any major difficulty.</dd>
